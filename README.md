# PhotonAlarmSystem

A Homebrew Alarm System built using Particle Photon and integrated with VictorOps Alerting.

This project was built on the Particle.io Web IDE.  Because of this it has no makefile. As of
now there is not easy way to open this in the Web IDE.  Rather just recreate these file names
in the IDE and copy the contents to the files.  It should build easily after that.

To Do's to use this software:

1) Build the hardware as documented in the schematics
2) Redefine the static zones according to your system.
3) Build a webhook in the particle.io site as documented in the Description.pdf file

Enjoy!
